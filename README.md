# Time Since I...

## Project Idea & Brief Description
"Time Since I..." is a web application that helps users track the time since they last completed an activity. Unlike recurring alarms, which can get out of sync when missed, this app provides a simple "Done It" button to reset the timer dynamically. The goal is to help users manage habits, chores, and personal activities efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) & Render/Heroku (Backend)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Features
- Track various activities and how long since they were last done.
- Simple "Done It" button to reset the timer.
- Customizable time limits and reminders.
- Task grouping and categorization.
- User authentication & account management.
- Optional sharing with family groups.
- Recommendation engine for recurring tasks.
