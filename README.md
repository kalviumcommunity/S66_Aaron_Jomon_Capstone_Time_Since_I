## Project Idea & Brief Description
"Time Since I..." is a web application that helps users track the time since they last completed an activity. Unlike recurring alarms, which can get out of sync when missed, this app provides a simple "Done It" button to reset the timer dynamically. The goal is to help users manage habits, chores, and personal activities efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) & Render/Heroku (Backend)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Features
- âœ… Track various activities and how long since they were last done
- âœ… Simple "Done It" button to reset the timer
- âœ… User authentication & account management (JWT-based)
- âœ… Activity creation with name, description, and frequency
- âœ… Visual time indicators (color-coded based on frequency)
- âœ… Activity editing and deletion
- âœ… Responsive design with modern UI
- âœ… Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware
- âœ… Input validation and error handling
- ðŸ”„ Task grouping and categorization (future enhancement)
- ðŸ”„ Optional sharing with family groups (future enhancement)
- ðŸ”„ Recommendation engine for recurring tasks (future enhancement)

## How to Run Locally

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the Backend directory: `cd Backend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Set up your MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file
5. Start the server: `npm run dev` (development) or `npm start` (production)

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the Frontend directory: `cd Frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Update the API URL in `.env` if needed (defaults to production backend)
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

### Environment Variables
- **Backend**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your values
- **Frontend**: Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env` to point to your backend

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### Activities (Protected Routes)
- `GET /api/activities` - Get all activities for authenticated user
- `POST /api/activities` - Create new activity
- `PUT /api/activities/:id` - Update activity
- `DELETE /api/activities/:id` - Delete activity
- `PATCH /api/activities/:id/done` - Mark activity as done

### User
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
